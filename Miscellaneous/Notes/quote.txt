Code is like detective work, every bugs has a story, you just have to read it right.


CP doesn't care how you feel.
If you're not consistent, you're not improving.


I skipped the thinking part - and that's where real growth happens.
Every time you avoid the pain, you're avoiding the progress.


You can't dodge math in CP.
It's not optional. It's the core.


Contests are where you test.
Upsolving is where you learn.


Planning felt productive. But it was just procrastination wearing tie.


I lied to myself, repeatedly "I'm trying" - When I wasn't.


You don't need a new tutorial,
You don't need more motivation,
You just need to stop lying to yourself.
Put in the work. Sit with the pain. Make this the moment you change.
