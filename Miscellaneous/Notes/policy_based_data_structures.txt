Policy Based Data Structures
------------------------------
- Ordered Set
- Based on Red Black Trees
- Include in
- pbds = set + multiset with 2 extra utilizing function.

#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
#define pbds tree<ll, null_type, less<ll>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update>

- less<ll>, greater<ll>, less_equal<ll>, greater_equal<ll>

- normal set operations
- random access in O(logN)
- number of items less than k in O(logN)

Code
-----
It has two key function: O(logN)

pbds s

- s.order_of_key(k) : number of items strictly smaller than k. O(logN)

- s.find_by_order(k): k-th element in a set (counting from zero). returns pointer (0-base indexed). O(logN)

- Rest all of are all set operations.

* In pbds when declare it as a multiset (greater_equal<ll>) it creates problem when we are trying to erase any element from it. So, for that we can't declare as multiset, we have to declare as set (less<ll>) and for duplicate we maintain a pair to track the element with its index.
