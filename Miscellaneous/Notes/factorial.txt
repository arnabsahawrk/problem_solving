-> Factorial
: N! = N*(N-1) * (N-2) * (N-3)*....
- 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
- Exception 0! = 1

- Consider how other factorials are related
- 5! = 120 -> divide it by 5 -> 24
- 4! = 24 -> divide it by 4 -> 6
- 3! = 6 -> divide it by 3 -> 2
- 2! = 2 -> divide it by 2 -> 1
- 1! = 1 -> divide it by 1 -> stays 1
- 0! = 1

: Consider a cricket team with 4 players how many batting orders are possible -> 24 combinations (4 Factorial).
: Factorial we used for deal with permutation and combination.
