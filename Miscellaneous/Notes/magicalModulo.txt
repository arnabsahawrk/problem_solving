Whenever we see a problem having rotation in an array, for that particular problem we have magical an operator called modulo (%).

Fraction: Denominator represents the number of equal parts in a whole and the numerator represents how many parts are being considered.
----------

Denominator: The bottom number of a fraction.
------------
Numerator: The top number of a fraction.
-----------

2/5: here 5 is Denominator and 2 is numerator.

If we Modulo any n value with any x value we get the modulo result is 0 to (the value - 1)/2 and the value itself. For example:
10 = (10 - 1)/2;
   = 4
So, We Get {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10}

13 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13}
