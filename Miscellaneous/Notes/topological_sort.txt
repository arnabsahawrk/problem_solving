Topological Sort
------------------
-> It is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv for vertex u to v, u comes before vertex v in the ordering

-> Graph should be DAG

-> Ever DAG will have at least one topological ordering

For sort in topological order: first we have to find out 0 indegree vertex write it down and delete it with its edges the again find out 0 indegree vertex. process will continue and finally we will get the topological sort order.

whenever in problem state that something before something the first intuition should be flash through in mind topological sort.
