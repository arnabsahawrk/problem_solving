Bitmask
---------
A bitmask is a binary number used to perform bitwise operations on other binary numbers, often to extract, set, or clear specific bits. It's a way to manipulate individual bits within a larger data unit, like a byte or an integer. 

Sequence of bits or combination of bits that represent a subset of set.

What it is:
*A bitmask is essentially a pattern of 0s and 1s, where each bit represents a specific bit position within the target data.
*It acts as a filter, allowing to isolate and work with individual bits.

for a length of set n the subset will be 2^n - 1
n = 0-(2^n-1)
0 - 7

Here, every Sequence of bit is bitmask.
